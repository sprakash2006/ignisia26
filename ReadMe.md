Enterprise Knowledge Retrieval & Support Platform

> A production-grade **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** platform for multi-format
> document intelligence, built around three pillars: **data integrity** (conflict &
> duplicate detection), **role-based access control** (org-hierarchy aware), and
> **grounded, citation-backed answers** (strict anti-hallucination prompting).

PaperTrail lets an organization upload its documents and emails, ask natural-language
questions across all of them, and get answers that are **only** grounded in those
sources — complete with citations, data-quality warnings, and automatic resolution of
contradictory information. It also includes a full **AI-assisted customer support
ticketing** workflow that drafts and sends resolution emails from the knowledge base.

## 🌐 System Overview

The platform ships as **three hostable components**:

| Component | Stack | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI + the core RAG engine | API, ingestion, retrieval, conflict detection, embeddings |
| **Frontend** | React 19 + Vite (static SPA) | Auth, chat, upload, email, tickets, dashboard UI |
| **Supabase** | Postgres + pgvector + Auth + Storage | Persistence, vector search, RBAC, file storage |

The **core RAG engine** (`backend/engine/` — `rag_ingestor.py`, `conflict_detector.py`,
`email_fetcher.py`) is storage-agnostic and lives inside the backend; the FastAPI
services wire it to Supabase **pgvector** (HNSW) for multi-tenant, persistent,
auth-gated retrieval.

## ✨ Feature Reference (Every Feature)

### 1. Multi-Format Document Ingestion
Upload and index any combination of:

| Format | Extension | Extractor | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | `pdfplumber` | Per-page text extraction, page numbers preserved |
| Word | `.docx` | `python-docx` | Paragraph text + heading-based section tracking |
| Excel | `.xlsx` | `openpyxl` | **Row-level** chunking, multi-sheet aware |
| CSV | `.csv` | Python `csv` | **Row-level** chunking with header mapping |
| Plain text | `.txt` | native | Paragraph-based chunking |
| Email | `.eml` | `email` stdlib | Thread-split, header-tagged chunks |

Unsupported file types are safely skipped with a warning, and files that yield no
extractable content return a clear "no content extracted" message instead of failing
silently.

### 2. Format-Aware Chunking
Chunking strategy adapts to the document type to preserve structural meaning:

- **Spreadsheets (XLSX/CSV):** each row becomes one chunk, rendered as
  `[Sheet: X, Row: N] Header: value | Header: value | …`. This keeps each record
  self-describing so the LLM never loses column context. Sheet name is stored as the
  chunk's `section`.
- **PDF:** text is split per page (≤1000 chars/chunk) with page numbers retained for
  citation.
- **DOCX:** paragraphs are combined and split (≤1000 chars), with the most recent
  `Heading`-styled paragraph recorded as the `section`.
- **TXT:** paragraph-aware splitting (`\n\n` boundaries) with overflow handled
  line-by-line.
- **Email:** the body is split on quoted-reply / forwarded-message boundaries
  (`On … wrote:`, `---------- Forwarded message ----------`, `From:…Sent:`), each
  thread part tagged with a `[Email from / To / Subject / Date]` header line.

Every chunk carries metadata: `page`, `line`/`row`, `section`, and `source_date`.

### 3. Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search
- Embeddings generated locally with **`sentence-transformers` `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**
  (384 dimensions) — no embedding API cost.
- Vectors are stored in Postgres via the **pgvector** extension, indexed with **HNSW**
  (`m=16, ef_construction=64`) using cosine distance. Retrieval is done through the
  `match_chunks` SQL function, which combines similarity search **and** access control
  in a single query.
- A configurable similarity threshold (`MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.3`) filters out weak
  matches; `TOP_K` controls how many chunks are retrieved.

### 4. Retrieval-Augmented Q&A
For each question:
1. The query is embedded and the top-K most similar chunks are retrieved (`TOP_K = 15`).
2. Retrieved chunks are filtered by the asking user's access rights.
3. Chunks are analyzed for duplicates and conflicts.
4. A grounded context block (with source/page/line/section/date tags) is assembled.
5. The LLM (**`gpt-4o`**, temperature 0.2) answers using only that context.
6. Recent conversation history (last 10 messages) is included for follow-up questions.

### 5. Structured, Grounded Answers
Every answer is forced into a **mandatory four-section format**:

1. **✅ Final Answer** — the direct response.
2. **⚠️ Data Quality Notes** — missing values, conflicts, and duplicates (or
   "No data quality issues detected").
3. **🧾 Source References** — file name, page/row, and section for each fact used.
4. **🧠 Reasoning** — what was found, what was missing, how conflicts were resolved.

**Anti-hallucination guardrails:** the system prompt instructs the model to answer
**only** from the provided context, never use outside knowledge, and respond
*"Value not available in the source documents"* when the answer isn't present. Partial
answers must explicitly state what is missing.

### 6. Duplicate Detection
Before answering, retrieved chunks are scanned for **identical content appearing in
multiple sources**. Duplicates are reported to the user (with a text preview and the
list of locations) and passed to the LLM as an advisory so redundancy is noted in the
answer.

### 7. Conflict Detection & Resolution
A two-layer system catches contradictory facts across documents:

- **Heuristic layer** — parses `key: value` segments (especially from spreadsheet rows)
  and flags any field that has **different values across sources**.
- **LLM layer** (`ConflictDetector`, using **`gpt-4o-mini`**, temperature 0) — compares
  cross-source chunk pairs and detects semantic contradictions (e.g. different prices,
  refund windows, deadlines, contact details for the *same* thing), while ignoring
  merely supplementary or differently-worded info.

**Automatic resolution strategy** (`_resolve_conflict`):
1. **Recency wins** — the more recently dated source is trusted.
2. **Source-type priority** when dates tie — structured data ranks highest:
   `xlsx/xls (4) > csv (3) > pdf/docx (2) > txt/eml (1)`.
3. **Fallback** — if neither resolves it, the system flags the conflict for manual
   verification.

Resolved conflicts surface in the UI as warning cards showing the **trusted** vs.
**overridden** source, their dates, and the resolution rationale.

### 8. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Three roles with hierarchical document visibility:

| Role | Can see |
|------|---------|
| **Director** | All documents in the organization |
| **Manager** | Shared docs + own private docs + all (recursive) subordinates' private docs |
| **Employee** | Shared docs + own private docs only |

The org hierarchy is modeled via a self-referencing `reports_to` field. Subordinates
are resolved **recursively** via the `get_all_subordinates` SQL function. Access control
is enforced at **three** levels: the `match_chunks` retrieval query, the
document-listing service, and Supabase **Row-Level Security** policies.

### 9. Shared vs. Private Documents
Every document is either:
- **Shared** (org-wide, `owner_id = NULL`) — visible to everyone in the org.
- **Private** (`owner_id` set) — visible only per the RBAC rules above.

Uploaded emails are always ingested as **private** documents owned by the connecting
user. Deletion is restricted to the document owner or a director.

### 10. Email Integration (IMAP Auto-Ingestion)
- Connect any IMAP mailbox (Gmail, etc.) via server, address, password, and folder.
- **Test connection** endpoint validates credentials before saving.
- **Poll** fetches all `UNSEEN` messages, parses each (including multipart bodies and
  threaded replies), ingests them as private knowledge, and marks them `\Seen`.
- De-duplication via `Message-ID` tracking prevents re-ingesting the same email.
- `last_polled_at` is recorded per user; ingestion events are written to the audit log.
- Per-user email config is stored in the `email_configs` table (one config per user).

### 11. Conversations & Chat History
- Multi-conversation support — create, list (most-recent first), and delete
  conversations.
- Each message (user + assistant) is persisted with its **sources** and **analysis**
  (conflicts/duplicates) as JSONB.
- The last 10 messages of a conversation are fed back into the model for context-aware
  follow-ups.
- Conversations are strictly scoped to their owning user.

### 12. Customer Support Ticketing
A complete support desk built on the same knowledge base:

- **Raise a ticket** — public endpoint (no login required); captures customer name,
  email, phone, subject, query, category, and priority. Logged-in agents are recorded
  as the raiser; anonymous tickets are attributed to the demo org.
- **List & filter** — paginated ticket list (`page`, `per_page`) with optional status
  filter.
- **Stats** — counts by status (`total`, `open`, `in_progress`, `resolved`, `closed`).
- **Assign** — an agent claims a ticket, moving it to `in_progress`.
- **Internal notes** — agents add and list private notes on a ticket
  (`ticket_notes` table).
- Ticket lifecycle: `open → in_progress → resolved → closed`.

### 13. AI Ticket Resolution & Email Sending
When an agent resolves a ticket:
1. The customer's query is run through the **RAG engine** (with conflict/duplicate
   analysis).
2. A second LLM pass (`gpt-4o-mini`) formats the grounded answer into a **professional,
   customer-ready HTML email** — warm greeting by name, clean paragraphs, professional
   sign-off — while **stripping internal sections** (Data Quality Notes, Source
   References, Reasoning).
3. If conflicts were detected, the email is instructed to present **only the
   resolved/latest values** — never expose conflicting internal data to the customer.
4. The agent can **edit the drafted email body** before sending.
5. **Send** delivers the email via SMTP (`smtp.gmail.com:465` SSL), marks the ticket
   `email_sent` + `closed`, and guards against double-sending.

### 14. Audit Logging
Every significant action is recorded in the `audit_log` table with org, user, action
type, JSON details, and timestamp:
- `upload` — filename, visibility, chunk count
- `delete` — filename, document id
- `query` — question, source count, conflict count
- `email_ingest` — count and email metadata

Directors can view all org audit logs; users can view their own.

### 15. Authentication & User Management
- **Signup / Login** via Supabase Auth (JWT). On signup, a Postgres trigger
  (`handle_new_user`) auto-creates the user's `profiles` row with org, name, and role.
- **`/auth/me`** returns the current profile; **PATCH** updates name, `reports_to`, or
  avatar.
- **`/auth/org/members`** lists everyone in the caller's organization.
- Bearer-token auth is enforced on protected routes via the `get_current_user`
  dependency; an `get_optional_user` variant powers the public ticket form.
- Frontend route guards (`ProtectedRoute` / `PublicRoute`) gate pages by auth state.

### 16. Document Storage
Original uploaded files are stored in a private Supabase **Storage** bucket
(`documents`) under an `{org_id}/{user_id}/{filename}` path, with storage-level RLS
policies scoping access to the uploader's organization. Deleting a document also removes
its stored file.

## 🗄 Database Schema

Core tables (Postgres / Supabase):

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `organizations` | Tenants (multi-org ready) |
| `profiles` | Users: role, `reports_to`, org — extends `auth.users` |
| `documents` | File metadata: type, size, visibility, source, status |
| `chunks` | Text + `vector(384)` embedding + page/line/section/date |
| `conversations` | Chat threads per user |
| `messages` | Chat messages with `sources` + `analysis` JSONB |
| `email_configs` | Per-user IMAP settings |
| `tickets` | Support tickets + AI response + email body + lifecycle |
| `ticket_notes` | Internal agent notes |
| `audit_log` | All user actions |

**Key database functions:**
- `match_chunks(...)` — cosine-similarity vector search **with built-in RBAC**.
- `get_all_subordinates(manager_id)` — recursive CTE for org-hierarchy visibility.
- `handle_new_user()` — trigger that provisions a profile on signup.
- `update_updated_at()` — timestamp triggers.

**Security:** Row-Level Security is enabled on every table, with policies enforcing
org-scoping, document visibility, conversation ownership, and audit-log access. The HNSW
index on `chunks.embedding` powers fast vector search.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

**Backend** (`backend/.env` — copy from [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example)):
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Comma-separated frontend origins allowed to call the API (CORS).
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000

# Ticket email sending (SMTP) + IMAP email polling:
EMAIL_ADDRESS=you@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
EMAIL_FOLDER=INBOX
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env` — copy from [`frontend/.env.example`](frontend/.env.example)).
These are **build-time** values inlined into the bundle, so only ever use the public
anon key here:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

> For Gmail, use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), not your
> account password.

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

### Local development

**Backend** (from `backend/`):
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend** (from `frontend/`):
```bash
npm run dev    # Vite dev server on :5173, proxies /api → :8000
```

Then open the Vite URL (default `http://localhost:5173`). API docs are served at
`http://localhost:8000/docs`.

On Windows you can also use the helper scripts from the project root:
```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1     # FastAPI on :8000
.\start_frontend.ps1    # Vite on :5173
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Hostable Components)

The app is split into independently deployable components so you can host them on
any container platform (Render, Railway, Fly.io, AWS ECS, a VPS, etc.).

| Component | Artifact | Listens on | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Backend** | `backend/Dockerfile` | `:8000` | Stateless API; needs `backend/.env` |
| **Frontend** | `frontend/Dockerfile` | `:80` (nginx) | Static SPA + `/api` reverse proxy |
| **Supabase** | managed service | — | Run the SQL migrations once |

### Option A — Full stack with Docker Compose (one command)

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env     # fill in Supabase + OpenAI keys
cp .env.example .env                      # frontend build args (VITE_SUPABASE_*)
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend → **http://localhost:8080** (this is the URL you use the app from)
- Backend  → **http://localhost:8000** (direct API / `/docs`)

The frontend container's nginx proxies `/api` → the backend container, so the SPA
talks to the API over a single origin — no CORS issues in the browser.

### Option B — Build & run the components separately

**Backend:**
```bash
docker build -t PaperTrail-backend ./backend
docker run --env-file backend/.env -p 8000:8000 PaperTrail-backend
```

**Frontend** (Vite inlines `VITE_*` at build time, so pass them as build args):
```bash
docker build -t PaperTrail-frontend ./frontend \
  --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co \
  --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
docker run -p 8080:80 PaperTrail-frontend

### Hosting checklist

1. **Supabase** — create the project, enable the `vector` + `uuid-ossp` extensions, and
   run every file in `supabase/migrations/` in order.
2. **Backend** — deploy the image with `backend/.env` values set. Point `CORS_ORIGINS`
   at your real frontend URL (e.g. `https://app.example.com`).
3. **Frontend** — build with the production `VITE_SUPABASE_*` values. If the frontend is
   served from a different host than the backend, update the `/api` upstream in
   [`frontend/nginx.conf`](frontend/nginx.conf) (or set your platform's proxy/rewrite
   rule) to point at the backend's public URL.

## 🧪 Demo Data

The seed migrations create a **"PaperTrail Demo"** organization with a four-person
hierarchy:

| Name | Role | Reports To |
|------|------|------------|
| Arjun | Director | — |
| Meera | Manager | Arjun |
| Priya | Employee | Meera |
| Rahul | Employee | Meera |

Seed data also includes sample shared/private documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, EML — plus
intentionally `processing` and `failed` records to exercise UI states), pre-populated
conversations demonstrating clean answers, a duplicate-detection case, and a
conflict-resolution case, an example email config, and audit-log history. Log in as any
of the four users to watch RBAC filter results live.
